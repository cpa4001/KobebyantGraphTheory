# KobebyantGraphTheory
An analysis of Kobe Bryant's Basketball Career using Graph Theory

Plan
 - Import dataset about Kobe Bryant's shots over his career
 - Create a graph with no mapping at all
	 - nodes are locations 
	 - edges just distances between each other
	 - 
 - Start to map them over a court 
 - cluster them
